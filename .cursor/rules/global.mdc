# 🏗️ Strata Dev Framework Constitution

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE ARCHITECTURE AND WORKFLOWS DEFINED IN `.AgenticStrataFramework/Core Technical Specification 61087d4cd5cd48d2a9a58048d24689d7.md`.

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Zero Hallucination:** You DO NOT write code without a Plan.
2. **The Memory Rule:** Before editing ANY folder, you MUST read the `agents.md` file inside it (if it exists).
3. **Atomic Execution:** Execute strictly one story from `stories.json` at a time.
4. **Binary Verification:** You are done ONLY when the `acceptance_criteria` in `stories.json` are met.
5. **Context Hygiene:** Do not load documentation files unless specifically required by the Plan.

## 📋 Workflow Protocol (PPRE Cycle)

### PRIME Phase
- Load ONLY the current story from `docs/specs/stories.json`
- Load relevant `docs/reference/` files ONLY when needed
- Do NOT load the entire chat history

### PLAN Phase
- Generate a specific implementation plan in the chat
- Plan must be reviewed and approved before execution

### RESET Phase (The Kill Switch) ⚠️
- **CRITICAL:** Clear the context window/chat history
- This prevents "Context Rot"
- Only the approved Plan and relevant files remain in context

### EXECUTE Phase
- Write code based strictly on the Plan and Story constraints
- No improvisation or "creative interpretation"
- Follow binary acceptance criteria exactly

### VERIFY Phase
- Check code against `acceptance_criteria`
- Each criterion must evaluate to Pass or Fail
- No partial passes allowed

### COMMIT Phase
- If all criteria pass: Set `"passes": true` in JSON
- Log to `logs/progress.txt` with timestamp
- Git commit with story ID in message
- If any criterion fails: Update `agents.md` with lesson learned

## 🛑 Forbidden Patterns

- No `console.log` in production code
- No class components (Function components only for React)
- No direct CSS files (Use Tailwind CSS or styled-components)
- No code without a corresponding story in `stories.json`
- No skipping the RESET phase between PLAN and EXECUTE
- No executing a new story or coding task after Plan without performing RESET; conversation/clarifications are allowed, but execution must wait until RESET is done
- No git commit/push until the automated e2e suite has been executed and passes for the relevant changes
- No e2e suite that ignores acceptance_criteria: e2e must evaluate the binary acceptance_criteria of the active story in `stories.json` (TDD mindset). Include negative/error-path checks that assert what must NOT happen.

## 🚦 Execution Guardrails (must verbalize before coding)
- Identify the active story ID and restate its acceptance criteria.
- Confirm user approval to execute, then perform RESET explicitly.
- Load only the files needed for that story; avoid unrelated docs.
- State the validation you will run (e.g., build/tests) before finishing.
- Required checks per change (frontend): `npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test:e2e` (Playwright smoke).
- Required checks per change (backend sync): `cd jira-supabase-sync && npm test`.
- Do not start another story or edit unrelated files without a fresh PLAN+RESET.
- If a process error occurs, update `docs/reference/workflow.md` with the lesson.
- Scope guardrail: limit all file ops to `C:\Users\carlo\OneDrive\Documents\Delivery Manager Reporter` unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## 🧠 Memory System

- **Short-Term Memory:** `logs/progress.txt` - Session-level continuity
- **Long-Term Memory:** `src/**/agents.md` - Tacit knowledge and lessons learned
- **Constitutional Memory:** `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` - Universal rules
- **Reference Memory:** `docs/reference/*.md` - Loaded on-demand only

## 🔄 System Evolution

When a bug or failure occurs:
1. Fix the code (Linear work)
2. **MANDATORY:** Update the system memory:
   - Logic error → Update `src/**/agents.md`
   - Style error → Update `.cursor/rules/global.mdc`
   - Process error → Update `docs/reference/workflow.md`

If you fix a bug and do not update a `.md` file, you have **failed the protocol**.

## 📚 Documentation Standards

- PRD location: `docs/specs/prd.md` - Single source of truth
- Stories location: `docs/specs/stories.json` - Executable atoms
- Completed specs: `docs/done_specs/` - Archive location
- Active Sprints rules (UI): data from `sprint_metrics` + `sprints` + `issue_sprints`/`issues_normalized`; show only sprints with SP>0, no end_date pasada, y antigüedad < 90 días (end_date o last_seen_at/updated_at).
- Real data rule (tableros Overall/Delivery/Projects): no mocks en prod; todas las métricas deben venir de Supabase usando tablas/vistas reales (issues_normalized, sprint_metrics, issue_sprints, scope_changes, etc.). Si falta dato, mostrar estado vacío/error, no defaults sintéticos.
- Active Sprints refinado: requerir end_date presente, proyecto válido (no Unknown/vacío), descartar state closed/complete; ordenar por end_date más cercana.
